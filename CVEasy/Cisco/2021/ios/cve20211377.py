    This rule checks for the CVE-2021-1377 vulnerability in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software.
    The vulnerability is due to insufficient ARP entry management, which could allow an
    unauthenticated, remote attacker to prevent an affected device from resolving ARP entries
    for legitimate hosts on connected subnets, resulting in a denial of service condition.
    
    Note: This vulnerability exists because ARP entries are mismanaged. An attacker could 
    exploit this by continuously sending traffic that results in incomplete ARP entries.
