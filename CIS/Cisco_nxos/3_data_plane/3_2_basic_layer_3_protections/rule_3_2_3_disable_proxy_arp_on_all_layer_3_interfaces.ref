.rule_3_2_3_disable_proxy_arp_on_all_layer_3_interfaces

Reference: 
Remediation: Proxy ARP is disabled on all interfaces by default, and that configuration does not
appear in the running or saved configuration. Proxy ARP only appears in the
configuration if it is enabled (which is not desired in most cases).
To disable this on an interface if it is enabled:
switch(config-if)# no ip proxy-arp
for instance:


switch(config)# int vlan 9
switch(config-if)# no ip proxy-arp
