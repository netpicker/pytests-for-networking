.rule_3_1_3_1_set_interfaces_with_no_peers_to_passive_interface

Reference: 
Remediation: For each routeable interface, if there is no facing peer on that interface set that interface
to passive with the "ip ospf passive-interface" configuration command.
Every routeable interface should be set to either passive-interface, or be configured with
authentication keys.
switch(config)# int vlan 1
switch(config-if)# ip router ospf 10 area 0
switch(config-if)# ip ospf passive-interface
