# pytests for networking

We set out to revolutionize the way you can test the quality, design, compliance and security of your networks. Netpicker allows you to discover all your devices, back up configs and run automated health- and compliance tests, based on community supported (pytest) libraries for CIS hardening, common design validations, CVE checks and many more.
