"""
Test Name: HA BGP Prefix Consistency
Platform: fortinet
Tags: fw_test

Description:
This test ensures that all BGP neighbors on a Fortinet firewall advertise
the same set of prefixes â€” useful in HA firewall pairs where consistency
between neighbors is required.

The test does the following:
  - Runs "get router info bgp summary" to get neighbor IPs
  - Fetches "received-routes" from each neighbor
  - Compares the received prefixes to ensure they are identical
